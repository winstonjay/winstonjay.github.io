Hi I’m Karl, an artist, programmer and someone who studies media and communication technologies more generally.

This is a personal blog for writing about DIY data experiments, projects, new media / digital cultures, maybe contemporary art, possibly just things I feel like sharing. I haven’t really made my mind up yet tbh 👍. The working title here is like the Dostoevsky book, but chosen mainly because tech culture is always wanting to be smart and it seemed interesting to claim the opposite.

I’m quite busy writing other things at the moment so this space probably won’t get much content any time soon. Perhaps checkout the other blog I’m  currently working on for an MA project instead. 👉 [Digital Citizens blog](https://winstonjay.github.io/digitalcitizens/).
